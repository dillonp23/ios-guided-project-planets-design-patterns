// Class:
// pointer-based = references -> Holding a dog(class) by a leash(reference), anyone can come over, unleash your dog and change it for another dog


// Struct:
//value based = literally holding a dog in your arms, when you need to do something to it, you have to let it go and then get changed back
// Models should almost always be struct based


///both can implement protocols


// if no reason to change the properties, then should be setting them as constants.. easy weay to make sure that structs dont change from underneath you
